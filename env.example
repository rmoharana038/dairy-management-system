# Firebase Configuration
# Get these values from your Firebase project settings
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# Instructions to get these values:
# 1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
# 2. Select your project
# 3. Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
# 4. In the "General" tab, find "Your apps" section
# 5. Copy the values from the Firebase config object:
#    - apiKey → VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
#    - appId → VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
#    - projectId → VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID

# Note: These are public keys and are safe to use in frontend applications
# The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to expose them to the client
